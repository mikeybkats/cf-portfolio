There are lots of ways to determine the best movie playing – ticket sales, critical reviews, budget, ect. I felt that one of the biggest determinants in figuring out the movie to watch is what fellow movie goers are saying. So, the best movie is the one that get's the highest submitted user review.</p><p>All of the data is pulled from the <a href='https://www.themoviedb.org'>movie database api</a>, which collects the most up to date movie information available (at least data that is available for free :) </p><ul class='project-list'><li class='project-list-item'><div class='overlay image-box project-image' style='background: url(../images/moviefinder.jpg) center center / cover no-repeat border-box border-box;'><div class='imageOverlay'><a href='https://michael-moviefinder.herokuapp.com/' target='project-iframe'>Code 301 project: Moviefinder >> </a></div></div></li></ul>"

    "body": "<p>For most of my life I have been an artist. I make music, sketch, paint, construct things out of wood, and have worked as a designer too making bags, accessories and shoes. However, I have had a lifelong desire to code. It started in high school when I had a few friends that were making stuff in C++ and I just was really impressed by that. For about ten years I was simply someone who dabbled in web technologies: HTML, CSS ect. <br/><br/>My first real foray into any kind of actual web development started at <a href='https://www.codefellows.org'>Codefellows</a> in Seattle in 2016. When I say real, what I mean is: I actually began developing my process in a way where I started to build confidence in the projects I was working on. If I learned anything at Codefellows, it is to take problems one small bite at a time. And, although I am a very new developer I have tackled a wide range of different projects.</p><div style='background: url(../images/codefellows_coding.jpg) center center / cover no-repeat border-box border-box; min-width: 100%; height:260px;'></div><h4>It all started with code 201</h4><p>201 is an intro to javascript. It's a four week bootcamp that covers the most basic programming fundamentals, terminology and methods. During this course there were not additional technologies learned. All the projects were coded with vanilla javascript, html and css. There was the small addition of learning about code libraries and how to use them – but there was no jquery or anything so sophisticated allowed during the course.</p><ul class='project-list'><li class='project-list-item'><div class='overlay image-box project-image' style='background: url(../images/pub-capture.jpg) center center / cover no-repeat border-box border-box;'><div class='imageOverlay'><a href='https://mikeybkats.github.io/H2/' target='project-iframe'>final project: pub crawler >></a></div></div></li><li class='project-list-item'><div class='overlay image-box project-image' style='background: url(../images/busmall.jpg) center center / cover no-repeat border-box border-box;'><div class='imageOverlay'><a href='http://mikeybkats.github.io/busmall/' target='project-iframe'>project 4: busmall >> </a></div></div></li><li class='project-list-item'><div class='overlay image-box project-image' style='background: url(../images/coffee-shop.jpg) center center / cover no-repeat border-box border-box;'><div class='imageOverlay'><a href='http://mikeybkats.github.io/coffee-shop/' target='project-iframe'>project 3: coffee shop >> </a></div></div></li>   <li class='project-list-item'><div class='overlay image-box project-image' style='background: url(../images/michael-quiz.jpg) center center / cover no-repeat border-box border-box;'><div class='imageOverlay'><a href='http://mikeybkats.github.io/about-me/'' target='project-iframe'>project 2: text based game about me >> </a></div> </div></li><li class='project-list-item'><div class='overlay image-box project-image' style='background: url(../images/layout-page.jpg) center center / cover no-repeat border-box border-box;'><div class='imageOverlay'><a href='http://mikeybkats.github.io/Layout-Project/' target='project-iframe'>project 1: css layout page >> </a></div></div></li></ul><p class=''>After code 201 I moved onto codefellows 301.</p></div>"
